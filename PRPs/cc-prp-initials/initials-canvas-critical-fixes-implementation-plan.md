# Canvas Critical Fixes Implementation Plan

## PROJECT TECHNOLOGY STACK:

**Base Framework:** Next.js 15.3.2 with App Router + TypeScript 5.9.2
**AI Foundation:** Vercel AI SDK v5.0.26 (foundational - all AI operations built on this)
**UI Framework:** React 19.1.1 with Tailwind CSS 4.1.12, Radix UI, Framer Motion 12.23.12
**Authentication:** Better-Auth 1.3.7
**Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM 0.41.0
**Observability:** Langfuse SDK v4.1.0 with OpenTelemetry 2.1.0

**Critical UI Fixes:** Complete chart tools export system, implement data validation and sanitization, add chart count limits with memory management, and resolve TypeScript import path issues

---

## FEATURE PURPOSE:

**What specific UI functionality should this feature provide to users?**

This critical fix implementation will restore and secure the Canvas system's full functionality by:

1. **Unlocking Missing Chart Types**: Enable access to all 17 specialized chart tools (funnel, radar, geographic, treemap, sankey, etc.) that are currently inaccessible due to incomplete export system
2. **Securing Chart Data Input**: Implement comprehensive data validation and XSS prevention for all user-generated chart content to prevent malicious data injection
3. **Preventing Performance Degradation**: Add intelligent chart count limits and memory management to prevent application crashes with excessive chart creation
4. **Enabling Clean Development**: Resolve TypeScript compilation issues that block development workflow and CI/CD pipeline execution

**Primary User Impact:** Users will gain immediate access to 13 additional chart types, experience stable performance with large datasets, and benefit from secure chart data handling without any visible breaking changes.

---

## CORE UI COMPONENTS & FEATURES:

**Essential UI elements and interactions this fix implementation should provide:**

**Chart Tools Export System Completion:**
- Complete export registry in `src/lib/ai/tools/artifacts/index.ts` for all 17 tools
- Update main chart tool integration to recognize all specialized tools
- Ensure proper tool registration in chat API pipeline
- Verify Canvas integration for newly accessible chart types

**Data Validation & Sanitization UI:**
- Input validation indicators for chart data fields
- Error messaging system for invalid/dangerous data
- Progressive validation with user-friendly feedback

- Chart preview with sanitized data before Canvas rendering

**Chart Count Limits & Memory Management:**
- Chart count indicator showing current usage vs limits (e.g., "12/25 charts")
- Memory usage monitoring with visual indicators
- Graceful degradation warnings before reaching limits
- Chart cleanup suggestions and bulk deletion UI
- Performance optimization notifications

**TypeScript Integration Improvements:**
