# Canvas Chart Generation Pipeline Fix

## PROJECT TECHNOLOGY STACK:

**Base Framework:** Next.js 15.3.2 with App Router + TypeScript 5.9.2
**AI Foundation:** Vercel AI SDK v5.0.26 (foundational - all AI operations built on this)
**UI Framework:** React 19.1.1 with Tailwind CSS 4.1.12, Radix UI, Framer Motion 12.23.12
**Authentication:** Better-Auth 1.3.7
**Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM 0.41.0
**Observability:** Langfuse SDK v4.1.0 with OpenTelemetry 2.1.0

**Critical Fix:** Resolve perpetual loading states in Canvas chart generation where chart tools fail to complete execution pipeline, leaving artifacts stuck at loading icons indefinitely.

---

## FEATURE PURPOSE:

**Restore complete functionality to the Canvas chart generation system where users can:**
- Request chart creation and see charts render successfully in Canvas workspace
- Experience smooth loading ‚Üí processing ‚Üí success state transitions
- Generate 15+ chart types without execution pipeline failures
- Use only intended tools (chart artifacts) without unwanted code execution access
- See immediate visual feedback with properly completing chart tool execution

**Critical User Experience Issue:** Currently, users request charts but see perpetual loading spinners with no chart generation, breaking the core Canvas visualization workflow.

---

## CORE FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS & CRITICAL FIXES:

**Primary Pipeline Restoration:**
- Chart tool async generator execution completion (currently fails at final `return` statement)
- Artifact state transition from loading ‚Üí success (currently stuck at loading)
- Canvas rendering pipeline receiving completed chart data (currently never triggered)
- Tool permission system defaulting to chart-only access (currently includes unwanted code execution)

**Essential Execution Flow Components:**
- `src/lib/ai/tools/artifacts/*.ts` - 15 chart tools with async generator patterns
- `src/components/canvas-panel.tsx` - Canvas workspace with artifact state management
- `src/app/api/chat/shared.chat.ts` - Tool loading pipeline with permission validation
- `src/app/store/index.ts` - Default tool permission configuration
- `src/components/tool-invocation/*.tsx` - Chart rendering components receiving artifact data

**User Interaction Restoration:**
- "Create a bar chart" ‚Üí Chart tool executes ‚Üí Artifact created ‚Üí Canvas renders chart
- Canvas loading states properly transition through: loading ‚Üí processing ‚Üí success
- Chart components receive proper data structures for rendering
- No unwanted Python/JavaScript execution capabilities exposed to users

---

## EXISTING COMPONENTS TO LEVERAGE:

**Chart Tool Architecture (WORKING - just execution incomplete):**
- `src/lib/ai/tools/artifacts/bar-chart-tool.ts` - Async generator with yield pattern (execution starts but doesn't complete)
- `src/lib/ai/tools/artifacts/*.ts` - 15 specialized chart tools following same pattern
- `src/lib/ai/tools/tool-kit.ts` - Tool registry with comprehensive validation system
- `src/lib/ai/tools/chart-tool-registry.ts` - Chart tool validation and debugging utilities

**Canvas System Architecture (WORKING - waiting for completed artifacts):**
- `src/components/canvas-panel.tsx` - Main Canvas workspace with artifact state management
- `src/hooks/use-canvas.ts` - Canvas state management with artifact lifecycle tracking
- `src/components/canvas-panel.tsx:LoadingPlaceholder` - Loading state UI (currently shown indefinitely)
- `src/components/canvas-panel.tsx:ChartRenderer` - Chart rendering component (never receives data)

**Tool Execution Pipeline (PARTIALLY WORKING - permission system needs fix):**
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Main chat API with tool execution orchestration
- `src/app/api/chat/shared.chat.ts:loadAppDefaultTools` - Tool loading with extensive debugging
- `src/app/store/index.ts` - Tool permission defaults (currently includes unwanted toolkits)
- `src/lib/ai/tools/tool-kit.ts:APP_DEFAULT_TOOL_KIT` - Complete tool registry (properly structured)

**Chart Rendering Components (READY - waiting for data):**
- `src/components/tool-invocation/bar-chart.tsx` - Bar chart renderer
- `src/components/tool-invocation/*.tsx` - 15+ specialized chart components
- All chart components properly configured for Canvas integration

---

## TECHNICAL INTEGRATION POINTS:

**Vercel AI SDK Integration (CRITICAL FAILURE POINT):**
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts:streamText()` - Tool execution orchestration (tools start but don't complete)
- Async generator execution in chart tools not reaching final `return` statement
- Tool execution lifecycle: start ‚Üí yield states ‚Üí **FAILS HERE** ‚Üí return results
- Need debugging of tool execution completion in Vercel AI SDK context

**Canvas Integration (WAITING FOR COMPLETED TOOLS):**
- `useCanvas.addArtifact()` called when tools complete (currently never triggered)
- Artifact state management ready for tool results (currently only receives loading state)
- Canvas rendering pipeline configured for chart data (currently never receives data)

**Tool Permission System (IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED):**
- `src/app/store/index.ts:allowedAppDefaultToolkit` - Currently includes Code, WebSearch, Http toolkits
- Should default to `[AppDefaultToolkit.Artifacts]` only for chart-focused experience
- Permission system works correctly, just defaults are wrong

**Database Integration (NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS FIX):**
- No database changes needed - issue is execution pipeline, not data persistence
- Chart data is ephemeral and rendered in Canvas without persistence requirements

---

## DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:

**Async Generator Debugging Pattern:**
```typescript
// Chart tools use this pattern - need to identify where execution stops
execute: async function* ({ title, data }) {
  logger.info("üîß Tool execution started"); // ‚úÖ WORKS
  yield { status: "loading" };                // ‚úÖ WORKS
  yield { status: "processing" };             // ‚úÖ WORKS
  yield { status: "success" };                // ‚ùì REACHES HERE?
  logger.info("‚úÖ Tool execution completed"); // ‚ùå NEVER LOGGED
  return { content, structuredContent };      // ‚ùå NEVER EXECUTED
}
```

**Canvas State Management Pattern (WORKING):**
```typescript
// Canvas properly manages artifacts when tools complete
const addArtifact = useCallback((artifact: CanvasArtifact) => {
  // This works when called, but tools never complete to call it
  setArtifacts(prev => [...prev, artifact]);
  setIsVisible(true);
}, []);
```

**Tool Permission Fix Pattern:**
```typescript
// Current problematic default
allowedAppDefaultToolkit: [
  AppDefaultToolkit.Code,        // ‚ùå REMOVE: Enables Python/JS execution
  AppDefaultToolkit.Artifacts,  // ‚úÖ KEEP: Chart tools
  AppDefaultToolkit.WebSearch,  // ‚ùå REMOVE: Unnecessary for chart focus
  AppDefaultToolkit.Http,       // ‚ùå REMOVE: Unnecessary for chart focus
],

// Corrected default
allowedAppDefaultToolkit: [
  AppDefaultToolkit.Artifacts,  // ‚úÖ ONLY: Chart tools only
],
```

**Error Handling Pattern (NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION):**
- Add comprehensive error catching in async generator execution
- Implement timeout handling for tool execution (currently may hang indefinitely)
- Add fallback error states in Canvas when tool execution fails

---

## SECURITY & ACCESS PATTERNS:

**Tool Permission Security (IMMEDIATE CONCERN):**
- Current defaults expose Python/JavaScript execution capabilities users don't expect
- Should default to chart-only toolset for security and UX clarity
- Permission system architecture is sound, just default configuration wrong

**Chart Content Security (WORKING):**
- Chart tools implement comprehensive XSS prevention
- Input validation and sanitization already in place
- Security audit checks already implemented in chart tool validation

**No Authentication Changes Required:**
- Issue is tool execution completion, not access control
- Existing Better-Auth integration sufficient for this fix

---

## COMMON CHART TOOL EXECUTION GOTCHAS:

**Async Generator Execution Patterns:**
- Tool execution may be interrupted by race conditions in streaming context
- Vercel AI SDK tool execution lifecycle needs debugging for completion issues
- Generator functions may not properly handle all yield states before return
- Memory management issues in tool execution could cause hanging

**Canvas State Synchronization:**
- Canvas loading states depend on tool completion events that aren't firing
- Artifact state transitions work correctly when tool execution completes
- Loading placeholders shown indefinitely due to missing completion signals

**Tool Permission System Gotchas:**
- Default toolkit permissions include more than users expect
- Code execution tools enabled by default create security and UX confusion
- Permission changes require store state update and potentially cache clearing

**Performance Gotchas:**
- Large chart datasets could cause tool execution timeouts
- Memory leaks in incomplete tool execution cycles
- Canvas artifacts accumulating without proper cleanup on tool failures

---

## TESTING & VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:

**Tool Execution Testing:**
```bash
# Verify tool execution completion
pnpm dev
# In browser console, watch for:
# "üîß [CreateBarChart] Tool execution started"
# "‚úÖ [CreateBarChart] Tool execution completed" (currently missing)

# Test chart generation request
# Request: "Create a simple bar chart with test data"
# Expected: Loading ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Success ‚Üí Chart renders in Canvas
# Current: Loading ‚Üí [stuck indefinitely]
```

**Canvas Integration Testing:**
```bash
# Verify Canvas artifact state transitions
# Watch console for:
# "üé≠ useCanvas Debug: Adding artifact" (currently never triggered)
# "üé≠ CanvasPanel Debug: Rendering canvas panel" (works when artifacts present)
```

**Permission System Testing:**
```bash
# Verify tool permissions after fix
# Check that only chart tools are available
# Ensure no Python/JavaScript execution options visible
```

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
pnpm check-types      # Ensure TypeScript compliance
pnpm lint              # Code quality validation
pnpm test              # Unit test validation
pnpm build:local       # Build system validation
```

---

## DESIGN SYSTEM INTEGRATION:

**No Design Changes Required:**
- Canvas UI components already properly styled
- Loading states and chart rendering components work correctly
- Issue is functional (tool execution) not visual (UI design)
- Existing Tailwind CSS + Radix UI integration sufficient

**Color System Integration (WORKING):**
- Chart color variables properly configured (`var(--chart-1)`, etc.)
- Canvas styling consistent with design system
- Loading state animations and transitions already implemented

---

## FILE STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION:

**Primary Files Requiring Changes:**
```
src/app/store/index.ts                    # Fix: allowedAppDefaultToolkit defaults
src/app/api/chat/shared.chat.ts           # Debug: tool execution completion
src/lib/ai/tools/artifacts/*.ts           # Debug: async generator completion
src/components/canvas-panel.tsx           # Monitor: artifact state transitions
```

**Files for Investigation (No Changes Likely Needed):**
```
src/app/api/chat/route.ts                 # Monitor: tool execution orchestration
src/hooks/use-canvas.ts                   # Monitor: Canvas state management
src/components/tool-invocation/*.tsx      # Ready: chart rendering components
```

**New Files Not Required:**
- Issue is execution pipeline completion, not missing components
- All necessary infrastructure already exists and is properly structured

---

## CRITICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS:

**Root Cause Identification:**
1. **Primary Issue:** Chart tool async generators start execution but fail to reach final `return` statement
2. **Secondary Issue:** Tool permission defaults include unwanted capabilities (Python/JS execution)
3. **Symptom:** Canvas shows loading states indefinitely with no chart generation
4. **Architecture:** Sound - all components properly structured and waiting for tool completion

**Execution Pipeline Breakdown:**
```
User Request ‚Üí Tool Selection ‚úÖ ‚Üí Tool Execution Start ‚úÖ ‚Üí Yield Loading ‚úÖ ‚Üí
Yield Processing ‚úÖ ‚Üí Yield Success ‚ùì ‚Üí Return Results ‚ùå ‚Üí Canvas Update ‚ùå
```

**Critical Debug Points:**
- Chart tool execution reaches processing state but may not reach success state
- Final `return` statement never executes in chart tool async generators
- Canvas artifact creation never triggered due to missing tool completion

---

## INTEGRATION FOCUS:

**Vercel AI SDK Tool Execution (CRITICAL):**
- Tool execution lifecycle debugging required
- Async generator completion pattern investigation needed
- Streaming context may be interrupting tool completion
- Error handling for tool execution failures needs enhancement

**Canvas System Integration (READY):**
- Canvas components ready to receive artifact data
- State management properly configured for chart rendering
- UI components waiting for completed tool execution results

**No External Service Integration Required:**
- Issue is internal tool execution pipeline, not external API integration
- MCP servers, observability systems not involved in this failure

---

## ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:

**Existing Accessibility (WORKING):**
- Canvas and chart components already implement proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader support already in place
- Loading states properly announced to assistive technologies

**No Additional Accessibility Work Required:**
- Issue is functional completion, not accessibility compliance
- Existing patterns already meet WCAG 2.1 requirements

---

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:

**Current Performance Patterns (WORKING WHERE EXECUTED):**
- Chart rendering optimized with React.memo patterns
- Canvas state management uses proper debouncing (150ms)
- Memory leak prevention patterns already implemented

**Performance Issues From Incomplete Execution:**
- Tool execution hanging may cause memory leaks
- Incomplete artifact lifecycles prevent proper cleanup
- Canvas loading states consuming resources indefinitely

**Performance Optimization Post-Fix:**
- Tool execution completion will enable proper memory management
- Canvas artifact cleanup patterns will function correctly
- Chart rendering performance already optimized

---

## FEATURE COMPLEXITY LEVEL:

- [x] **Standard Feature** - Bug fix requiring systematic debugging of tool execution pipeline and simple configuration changes

**Complexity Justification:**
- Not a simple enhancement (execution pipeline debugging required)
- Not advanced/system integration (no new architecture needed)
- Standard debugging and configuration fix complexity level

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:

**Phase 1: Tool Permission Fix (2 minutes)**
1. Update `src/app/store/index.ts` - Change `allowedAppDefaultToolkit` to `[AppDefaultToolkit.Artifacts]`
2. Clear browser cache/state if necessary
3. Verify only chart tools available in UI

**Phase 2: Tool Execution Debugging (15 minutes)**
1. Add comprehensive logging to chart tool execution completion
2. Test chart generation request with debug console monitoring
3. Identify exact point where async generator execution stops
4. Implement error handling and timeout patterns if needed

**Phase 3: Validation (5 minutes)**
1. Verify chart generation completes successfully
2. Confirm Canvas renders charts properly
3. Validate no unwanted tool capabilities exposed
4. Run project health checks (`pnpm check-types`, `pnpm lint`)

**Expected Resolution Time:** 20-30 minutes total
**Confidence Level:** 9/10 - Clear architectural diagnosis with specific fix points identified

---

## CLAUDE CODE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:

**Immediate Implementation Steps:**
1. **Configuration Fix:** Update tool permission defaults (immediate)
2. **Execution Debugging:** Add logging to identify tool completion failure point
3. **Pipeline Restoration:** Implement fixes for async generator completion
4. **Validation Testing:** Verify complete chart generation workflow
5. **Performance Monitoring:** Ensure no regressions in Canvas performance

**Success Criteria:**
- Chart generation requests complete successfully (loading ‚Üí processing ‚Üí success ‚Üí rendered)
- Canvas displays charts immediately after tool execution completion
- Only chart/artifact tools available to users (no code execution)
- No performance regressions or memory leaks
- All existing functionality preserved

---

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**
- **Root Cause Focus:** Address tool execution completion failure, not UI redesign
- **Minimal Changes:** Fix execution pipeline without architectural modifications
- **User Experience:** Restore immediate chart generation feedback
- **Security Improvement:** Default to chart-only tool permissions
- **Performance Preservation:** Maintain existing Canvas optimization patterns

**Confidence Score: 9/10** - This initial plan provides a solid foundation for successful PRP generation and rapid issue resolution based on comprehensive architectural diagnosis and clear identification of critical failure points.
