    - "Implement unit tests (Task 95a9db95)"

  summary: |
    Phase 1 Tool Routing implementation is EXCELLENT and ready for production.
    All three tasks meet requirements with high code quality and comprehensive
    error handling. Build and lint validations passed successfully.

    BONUS: Significant portions of Phase 2 (Persistence) and Phase 3 (History)
    are already implemented and integrated, accelerating overall project timeline.

    Recommended action: APPROVE and proceed to manual testing, then begin
    unit test implementation.
