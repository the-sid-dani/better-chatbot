## Preview

Get a feel for the comprehensive capabilities ‚Äî here's what makes Samba Orion unique.

### üìä Canvas Workspace & Multi-Chart Dashboards

<img width="1912" height="953" alt="canvas-workspace" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/canvas-visualization-demo" />

**Example:** Real-time data visualization with progressive chart building as AI creates insights.

- **16+ Chart Types**: Bar, line, pie, area, funnel, radar, scatter, treemap, sankey, radial bar, composed charts, geographic maps (world/US), gauge, and calendar heatmaps
- **Progressive Building**: Charts stream to Canvas workspace as AI processes data and creates visualizations
- **Smart Dashboard Layout**: Multi-grid system that scales from single charts to complex dashboards
- **Interactive Canvas**: Resize, reorganize, and manage multiple visualizations in a unified workspace
- **Geographic Intelligence**: World maps and US state/county visualizations with TopoJSON support

Canvas integrates seamlessly with chat using ResizablePanelGroup for optimal screen real estate management.

### üë• Admin Dashboard & User Management

<img width="1567" alt="admin-dashboard" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/admin-management-ui" />

**Example:** Comprehensive administrative control for team deployments and agent management.

- **User Management**: Role-based access control, user analytics, and account administration
- **Agent Permissions**: Granular control over who can use, edit, or access custom agents
- **System Analytics**: Track usage patterns, model performance, and cost analytics
- **Tabbed Interface**: Clean organization of agents, users, and system settings
- **Permission Levels**: Use vs Edit permissions with selective sharing capabilities

### üß© Browser Automation with Playwright MCP

![preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4febb04-26d5-45da-a7bb-f7d452d333c2)


**Example:** Control a web browser using Microsoft's [playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) tool.

- The LLM autonomously decides how to use tools from the MCP server, calling them multiple times to complete a multi-step task and return a final message.

Sample prompt:

```prompt
1. Use the @tool('web-search') to look up information about ‚Äúmodelcontetprotocol.‚Äù

2. Then, using : @mcp("playwright")
   - navigate Google (https://www.google.com)
   - Click the ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù button
   - Enter my email address (neo.cgoing@gmail.com)
   - Clock the "Next"  button
   - Close the browser
```

<br/>

### üîó Visual Workflows as Custom Tools

<img width="1912" height="953" alt="workflow" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e69e72e8-595c-480e-b519-4531f4c6331f" />

<img width="1567" alt="workflow-mention" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf3e1339-ee44-4615-a71d-f6b46833e41f" />

**Example:** Create custom workflows that become callable tools in your chat conversations.

- Build visual workflows by connecting LLM nodes (for AI reasoning) and Tool nodes (for MCP tool execution)
- Publish workflows to make them available as `@workflow_name` tools in chat
- Chain complex multi-step processes into reusable, automated sequences

<br/>

### ü§ñ Custom Agents with Granular Permissions

<img width="1567" alt="agent-example" loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0a325c0-ff1e-4038-b6bf-fcf57659a5c1" />

**Example:** Create specialized AI agents with sophisticated permission controls and tool access management.

- **Custom Instructions**: Define specific system prompts, personalities, and behavioral guidelines
- **Tool Access Control**: Configure which MCP servers, workflows, and built-in tools each agent can use
- **Granular Permissions**: Set "use" or "edit" permissions for different users and teams
- **Visibility Levels**: Private, public, readonly, admin-shared, admin-selective, and admin-all access levels
- **Smart Invocation**: Easily invoke agents in chat using `@agent_name` with context awareness

**Advanced Use Cases:**
- **GitHub Manager Agent**: With GitHub MCP tools, repository context, and selective team access
- **Data Analysis Agent**: With Canvas visualization tools, Python execution, and read-only sharing
- **Customer Support Agent**: With knowledge base access, limited tool permissions, and public availability
- **Admin Utility Agent**: With system tools, administrative permissions, and admin-only access

The permission system supports complex organizational structures with fine-grained access control.

### üéôÔ∏è Realtime Voice Assistant + MCP Tools

<p align="center">
  <video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2657b8c-ce0b-40dd-80b6-755324024973" width="100%" />
</p>

This demo showcases a **realtime voice-based chatbot assistant** built with OpenAI's new Realtime API ‚Äî now extended with full **MCP tool integration**.
Talk to the assistant naturally, and watch it execute tools in real time.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Tool Mentions (`@`) & Presets

<img width="1225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfe76b3b-c3d8-436e-8a7c-7b23292e234c" loading="lazy"/>

Quickly call tool during chat by typing `@toolname`.
No need to memorize ‚Äî just type `@` and pick from the list!

**Tool Selection vs. Mentions (`@`) ‚Äî When to Use What:**

- **Tool Selection**: Make frequently used tools always available to the LLM across all chats. Great for convenience and maintaining consistent context over time.
- **Mentions (`@`)**: Temporarily bind only the mentioned tools for that specific response. Since only the mentioned tools are sent to the LLM, this saves tokens and can improve speed and accuracy.

Each method has its own strengths ‚Äî use them together to balance efficiency and performance.

You can also create **tool presets** by selecting only the MCP servers or tools you need.
Switch between presets instantly with a click ‚Äî perfect for organizing tools by task or workflow.

### üß≠ Tool Choice Mode

<img width="1225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc64c6a-30c9-41a4-a5e5-4e8804f73473" loading="lazy"/>

Control how tools are used in each chat with **Tool Choice Mode** ‚Äî switch anytime with `‚åòP`.

- **Auto:** The model automatically calls tools when needed.
- **Manual:** The model will ask for your permission before calling a tool.
- **None:** Tool usage is disabled completely.

This lets you flexibly choose between autonomous, guided, or tool-free interaction depending on the situation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Built-in Tools

#### üåê Web Search with Semantic AI

<img width="1034" height="940" alt="web-search" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/261037d9-e1a7-44ad-b45e-43780390a94e" />
